# Learning-MLP-wit-Iris-dataset
Initially, the goal of this project is to construct a simple machine learning model fro ground level, in this case Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), for classifying iris datasets. 




MLP Algorithm

Step 1: Set the weight and bias to a small-random value.

Step 2: Forward Propagation, which involves propagating all values from the input layer to the output layer.

Step 3: Using backward propagation from output to input, update the weight and bias in the inner layer.

Step 4: Iterate until the stop condition is met.
